# gmodetector_py
CubeGLM is a Python package for analyzing fluorescent hyperspectral images. Key features include the abilities to quantify known spectral components (e.g. GFP and chlorophyll, in the context of plant biology) in each pixel of hyperspectral images (A.K.A. hypercubes) as well as producing false color images to allow visualization of each component's concentration in each pixel. This package was developed for use in the [GMOdetector workflow](https://github.com/naglemi/gmodetector_py/) to study plant transformation; however, it can be used to analyze any hyperspectral images in which the number of spectral components is low enough for them to be quantified by regression without high levels of noise.
